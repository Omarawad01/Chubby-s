GAME NAME: Chubbys

The game is based upon a flappy bird with a similar concept, we allowed the pips to be able to move one direction while the bird is stationary and this allowed us to implement the jump function in its space. 
The music and sound effects were from unity asset store the UI shows the start, pause and win condition. We all worked together to complete the game, it was shared and we all helped one another if someone got stuck.
